# News Site

I created a magazine site about chocolate, containing a header (with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar), a big news section and a section for other news. I made the site responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

I first planned my layout for mobile, tablet and desktop. I mostly used HTML and CSS, and some Javascript for the hamburger menu. The tools I used were Flexbox and CSS Grid to lay out the page. I used the internet to help me fix problems. If I had more time I would get my hamburger menu to function better.
